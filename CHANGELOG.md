[1.1.1]: https://github.com/bsi-software/bsi-cx-design-master-template-email/releases/tag/1.1.1


## [1.1.0] - 13.12.2022

### Changed
* New properties added to support Library 1.1.0 features
* Support to change the visited link color for CTA Button on Outlook for windows
* Better CSS reset for Outlook
* Dependency updates

Pay attention to the following breaking changes, that came in with the new library release:
* CTA Button: We've added a new default implementation that is more robust among different clients. As a consequence, rounded corners in Outlook are no longer supported. If you intend to keep the previous implementation, set 'buttonLegacyVml: true' in the properties.js
* Dark Footer Layout: the dark background color now spans over the entire width, which is the default use case for most brands.

For all new features and bug fixes, please refer to the [Library 1.1.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/bsi-software/bsi-cx-design-standard-library-email/releases/tag/1.1.0)
